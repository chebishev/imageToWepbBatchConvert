# imageToWepbBatchConvert
using the engine of google developers (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) I've made a program that can do batch conversions of images to webp files

supporting formats are "png", "jpeg", "jpg", "tiff", "webp"
animated png and webp are not supported.


Whatch the demo in youtube
