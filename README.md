üñºÔ∏è Image to WebP Batch Convert
Batch convert static and animated images to .webp format using Google‚Äôs [libwebp](https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp/) engine.

This lightweight Python tool uses the native binaries from [WebP‚Äôs official releases](https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html), bundled inside the project (in the webp_convert folder). The latest included version is libwebp 1.5.0. But the version by today (11.07.2025) is 1.6.0


Supported formats are "png", "jpeg", "jpg", "tiff", gif and "webp".
As you can see on the demo any other format can be converted too, but the output isn't guaranteed, so try other formats on your own risk.
The program will show them in the REPORT anyway with warning message that they may be not usable.

This version of the program is currently working on Windows OS, but you can make changes for your desired OS in "config.py"
