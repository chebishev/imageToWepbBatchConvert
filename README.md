# imageToWepbBatchConvert
Using the engine of google developers (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) I've made a program that can do batch conversions of images to webp files

Supported formats are "png", "jpeg", "jpg", "tiff", "webp".
Animated png and webp are not supported. As you can see on the demo any other format can be converted too, but the output isn't guaranteed, so try other formats on your own risk.
The program will show them in the REPORT anyway with warning message that they may be not usable.

This version of the program is working on Windows OS
